# baskup
Comprehensive iMessage Backup

# What is baskup?

baskup is a bash script that is aimed at taking your iMessages, which Apple stores on your local machine in non-readable iChat files, and copying them into human-readable text files.
baskup is a comprehensive service, meaning it will backup all messages sent, be it to a user with iMessage or SMS, as well as your audio and image files. 

# Why baskup? 

Baskup furthers the work of https://github.com/kyro38 's iMessage backup script by reducing the need for user input and backing up all of the user's messages. 

# How do I use baskup? 

To use baskup:

Download baskup, making sure it is stored in your Downloads folder as 'baskup-master'

Open terminal

Type: cd ./Downloads/baskup-master

Run: bash baskup.sh

Your bask-up master folder will now begin to be filled with your backups. This may take some time, so be patient. 

You're done!
