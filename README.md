Download the MacOS app for contact recognition, timestamps, and automated backups (coming soon)

*Most future improvements to Baskup will only be available on the desktop version.*

## What is Baskup?

Baskup is a bash script that is aimed at taking your iMessages, which Apple stores on your local machine in non-readable iChat files, and copying them into human-readable text files.
Whether it's a group message, picture, audio file, iMessage, or SMS, Baskup will back it up.

## Why baskup? 

Baskup furthers the work of https://github.com/kyro38 's iMessage backup script by reducing the need for user input and backing up all of the user's messages. 

## How do I use Baskup? 

To use baskup:

Download Baskup from this page by clicking download zip in the top right corner and then unzip the download

1. Run: cd (path of the downloaded baskup folder, i.e *cd ~/Downloads/baskup-master*)

2a. Run: *bash baskup.sh* to only backup messages
2b. Run: *bash baskup.sh -a* to backup messages AND attachments

Your bask-up master folder will now begin to be filled with your backups. This may take some time, so be patient. 


## All done
